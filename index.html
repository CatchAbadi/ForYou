        <p>Dear Elia，The love of my life</p>
        <p>Happy 3 Month anniversary，</p>
        <p>Our relationship has been moving extremely quickly for just 3 months.</p>
        <p>I used to find that as a problem,</p>
        <p>but now I know it isn't. </p>
        <p>The reason we have been moving so fast is because we both, in our hearts, truly believe we have found THE ONE。</p>
        <br />
        <p>I fall in love with you more and more every single day. You will never know exactly how much you mean to me.</p>
        <p>The more that time passes the happier I get and the more proud I am of the life that you allow me to live.</p>
        <p>I love everything about you.</p>
        <p>Your smile，your eyes, your golden heart, your soul and so much more.</p>
        <p>It feels like I'm dreaming when I'm with you。</p>
        <br />
        <p>It can be very hard to find your soulmate for some.</p>
        <p>Which is why I'm so glad that I've found you already.</p>
        <p>I need you to know that days pass quickly，but there is no wasted time with you</p>
        <p>So here is a record of how many days of our life will go unwasted。</p>
